<h4>Summary</h4>
<p class="parag-418">
We have implemented a general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">Convolutional Neural Networks</a> inference program using <a href="http://halide-lang.org/">the Halide image processing language</a> which is scheduled to be <span class="imp">fast(-er than Caffe, up to 3x)</span> on a single machine using CPU.

<h4>Background</h4>
<br/>
<h5><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">CNN</a></h5>
<p class="parag-418">
Lots of modern-day machine learning applications, such as AlphaGo, are using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification tasks. Therefore, the performance of training and inference with CNNs is fairly important. For huge data sets and large CNN configurations, training can take several days, making it meaningful to speed up the training process. Besides, in real-time applications, such as Apple Siri, the time spent in inference is also expected to be short, so that the delay will be tolerable or more satisfactory for users.
</p>

<p class="parag-418">For testing purpose, we are using <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST</a> (a database of handwritten digits and we use a typical CNN, <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/">LeNet</a> to perform inference on it) and <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">AlexNet</a>(which is designed to do classification towards <a href="http://image-net.org/">ImageNet</a>). 

<p class="parag-418">
The structure of LeNet is illustrated as below:</p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/resources/lenet.png" alt="lenet" height="152" width="600" /> 

<br/><br/>

<p class="parag-418">
The structure of AlexNet is illustrated as below:</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/resources/alexnet.png" alt="alexnet" height="252" width="600" /> 

<div class="par-blankline-10"></div>
<h5><a href="http://halide-lang.org/">Halide</a></h5>
<p class="parag-418">
Halide is a language and compiler for optimizing parallelism,locality, and re-computation in image processing pipelines. Since it provides many scheduling interfaces to handle matrices, it is a great source for CNN implementation, where the intermediate results are also matrices. Therefore, by carefully scheduling CNN training and inference with Halide, an obvious speedup is expected.
</p>

<div class="par-blankline-10"></div>
<h4>What we did (Results)</h4>
<p class="parag-418">
We have implemented this inference program which is tested towards MNIST (LeNet) and <a href="https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/models/bvlc_alexnet"> AlexNet (ImageNet)</a>, and it is compared against <a href="https://github.com/BVLC/caffe">Caffe</a> (testing of the network). Luckily, we have achieved better performance than Caffe in our limited tested scenarios. The following figures and data generally use Caffe as their counterpart for comparison. Our implementation is referred to as <span class="brom">"bromide"</span>.
</p>

<p class="parag-418">
The <span class="imp">throughput</span> of LeNet is illustrated as below:</p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/resources/lenet_throughput.jpg" alt="lenet" height="462" width="600" /> 
<br/><br/>

<p class="parag-418">
The <span class="imp">latency</span> of LeNet and AlexNet is illustrated as below: (<span class="imp">latency</span> here stands for the time to perform inference on a single input image, the smaller the better)
</p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/resources/latency.jpg" alt="latency" height="452" width="600" /> 
<br/><br/>

<p class="parag-418">
As we can see from the figures above, for the batchsize 16 of LeNet, the speedup (in terms of throughput) of Bromide over Caffe is roughly <span class="imp">3.04x</span>, and the average latency is <span class="imp">21% (LeNet) and 26% (AlexNet) better</span> than Caffe. Although these are not very significant, the results surely give us some hope in the power of scheduling in Halide.
</p>

<h5>Experimental setup:</h5>
<p class="parag-418">
<span class="imp2">Input (LeNet): </span>28x28x1 <br/>
<span class="imp2">Input (AlexNet): </span>227x227x3<br/>
<span class="imp2">Output: </span>label/classification of the picture. We actually stopped after the last layer (softmax) because choosing the most likely label is irrelevant with the performance, so this part is cut after we tested the correctness of the network)<br/>
<span class="imp2">Machine: </span>all of these tests are conducted on a machine that has 2 processors (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz). This kind of CPU has 4 cores and 8 thereads, with 8MB cache size.<br/>
<span class="imp2">Batch size: </span> batch size stands for the number of images for one batch of input. It ranges from 1 to 256, so we have a good observation of the change of performance.<br/>

<div class="par-blankline-10"></div>
<p class="parag-418">We can tell that most time-consuming layers, as we expected, is convolutional layers and fully connected layers. constant_exterior mostly take place in convolution layers and the last 3 sum functions are in fully-connected layers. Therefore, what we can do is to further tune the convolutional layer and fully connected layer. One thing we noticed when we compared to Caffe is that, our convolutional layer outperforms Caffe a lot, while Caffe's fully-connected layer performs better than Bromide's. This is not unexpected, because there is still a lot to do in the scheduling of <span class="imp2">fully-connected </span> layer. If we can futher reduce the time there (getting rid of sum() reduction and performing more fine-tuning), the performance of bromide would be a lot more desirable.</p>

<div class="par-blankline-10"></div>
<h4>How we did it (A: Methodology)</h4>

<p class="parag-418">
Usually, when we implement a CNN, we would like to build it layer by layer. One problem lying here is that every time we transmit the intermidiate results from one layer to its successor layer, we need to do a read and a write. 
</p><p class="parag-418">
This seems natural, but sometimes unnecessary. Take activation layer as an example, it's doing per-element computation, such as applying a ReLU function to all elements in the intermediate maps. Actually, this procedure can be embedded in the either the previous layer or the next layer, to avoid a read and a write. This loop-fusion method can be easily impelemented using Halide.  
</p><p class="parag-418">
Another thing worth noting is that the proper use of L3 cache can greatly increase the performance. When the data need to be reused, we can benefit from letting the data sit in the cache and wait for being called next time. Convolution layer, pooling layer, normalization layer and fully-connected layer are probably involved with data reuse. Therefore, tiling the maps can be a reasonable way. 
</p><p class="parag-418">
Also, we are supposed to make good use of SIMD and multi-threading techniques, based on their different characteristics. When using SIMD, we hope there's less divergence. Fortunately, most of the computations in CNN don't include braches. Therefore, we can use SIMD either in the inner loop or the outer loop. When using multi-threading, we hope there's less synchronization. Also, we note that the total number of threads in a machine is far less than the actual parallelizable units. To reduce synchronization, it's better to put multi-threading at the outer loop of the embedded loops. 
</p><p class="parag-418">
Furthermore, other scheduling approaches, such as tiling, unrolling, and reordering, can be applied here, depending on the specific layers and map sizes.
</p>


<!--&&&&&& divider &&&&&&-->
<div class="par-blankline-10"></div>
<h4>How we did it (B: Details)</h4>
<p class="parag-418">
We would introduce the details of the implementation (majorly scheduling) by each layer. Flatten layer, activation layer and drop layer are fairly straightforward thus we would mainly discuss other layers about their scheduling.
</p>
<p class="parag-418">
There are mainly two versions of our code, and, intuitively, version 2 is the more tuned version. The following discussion might include the comparison of the two versions.
</p>

<h5>Basic Settings</h5>
<p class="parag-418">
Every layer has a member called <span class="imp2">cnnff</span>, standing for the collection of the feedforward values. It generally has 4 dimensions, <span class="imp2">(x, y, z, w)</span>, corresponding to the column-index, row-index, map-index (3rd dimension), and batch size. All those layers are written in separate files and they are welded in the main function to build networks for testing. Scheduling is performed inside the layers.
</p>


<h5>Input Layer</h5>
<p class="parag-418">
We process the input data (trained weights) using a similar way to Caffe. The model (bvlc_alexnet.caffemodel) and mean (imagenet_mean.inarayproto) are parsed based on the functions provided by Caffe responsible for translating files using Protocol Buffer.
</p>

<h5>Convolutional Layer</h5>
<p class="parag-418">
Version 1:
</p>
<blockquote class="parag-418">conv_basic(x, y, z, w) = Halide::sum(last_layer.cnnff(x + dom.x, y + dom.y, dom.z + group_idx * input_group_size, w) * kernels(dom.x, dom.y, dom.z, map_idx + group_idx * group_size) + bias(z));</blockquote>
<p class="parag-418">
We are mainly doing intuitive implementation as well as using <span class="imp2">Halide::sum()</span> and <span class="imp2">Func.ompute_root()</span> in version 1. In convolutional layer, each pixel of an output map is computed according to the definition as the weighted sum of a filter window.
</p>
<p class="parag-418">
The <span class="imp2">Halide::sum()</span> function is used for inline reduction over the given domain (in this case, the domain would be 3-d, corresponding to the filter window of convolution). Func.compute_root() in Halide is used to compute the <span class="imp2">Func</span> ahead of the following program (<span class="imp2">Funcs</span> will be combined inline in Halide if there is no functions like compute_root() or compute_at() to explicitly order it to perform computation to the point). Func is a Halide class standing for a pipleline stage, which is a pure function that defines what value each pixel should have, similar to a computed image.
</p>

<p class="parag-418">
Version 2:<br/>
</p>
<blockquote class="parag-418">
  
input_ = Halide::BoundaryConditions::constant_exterior(last_layer.cnnff, 0, 0, last_layer.size[0], 0, last_layer.size[1]);<br/>
cnnff(x, y, z, w) = bias(z);<br/>
cnnff(x, y, z, w) += kernels(r.x, r.y, r.z % input_group_size, z) * input_(x * stride_x + r.x - pad_x, y * stride_y + r.y - pad_y, r.z, w);<br/>
cnnff.update().split(y, y_o, y_i, 32).split(z, z_o, z_i, 32); <br/>
cnnff.update().reorder(y_i, z_i, r.z, y_o, z_o).vectorize(x, 8); <br/>
cnnff.update().parallel(w);<br/>
cnnff.update().unroll(r.x).unroll(r.y);<br/>
input_.compute_at(cnnff, z_i);<br/>

</blockquote>
<p class="parag-418">
Convolution layer is a meaningful implementation exploiting the power of scheduling in Halide. We basically split y and z and reorder to get a tile, in order to find a point that reaches a good balance of memory traffic and locality which leads to a good performance. A typical tile would be loop over (from inner to outer) y_inner, y_outer, z_inner, z_outer, however, reordering the domain loop r.z before y_outer or z_outer would led to a elevation of performance because of more locality. Vectorization, parallelism and unrolling were performed here as well. It is fairly intuitive to vectorize over the innermost variable and parallelize the outermost one. Unrolling is performed at two innermost domain variables since they have a typically small range. The <span class="imp2">compute_at(func, var)</span> function performs computation of func for every unique value of var, which would enable us to compute the block of inner loop variables (y_i and z_i) to actually instantiate the above scheduling.
</p>

<h5>Fully Connected Layer</h5>
<blockquote class="parag-418">
Halide::RDom dom(0, last_layer.size[0]);<br/>
      cnnff(x, y, z, w) = Halide::sum(last_layer.cnnff(dom.x, y, z, w) * weights(dom.x, x)) + bias(x); <br/>
      cnnff.parallel(w);<br/>
          cnnff.vectorize(x, 8);<br/>
          cnnff.compute_root();<br/>
</blockquote>

<p class="parag-418">
Fully connected layer is basically a <span class="imp2">matrix multiplication</span>. If the batch size is equal to 1, it's a matrix multiplying vector. Otherwise, it's a multiplication between two matrices. Therefore, all the optimization methods can be used here. Note that for the multiplication between a matrix and a vector, there's data reuse only in terms of the vector, but no data reuse for matrix. So a reasonable scheduling is row-by-row multiplication between matrix and vector. However, for the multiplication between two matrices, more sophisticated methods should be considered. In this project, we tried tiling the matrices into blocks, and tuning the block size to let it fit in the L3 cache. But we found that in our experiments, similarly good perforamnce can be achieved by the straighforward impelmentation of matrix multiplication. 
</p>
<p class="parag-418">
Also, for both matrix-vector multiplication and matrix-matrix multiplication, we make use of <span class="imp2">SIMD</span> and <span class="imp2">multi-threading</span> implementation. We schedule them in different dimensions so that they can work together with less synchronization. We use multi-threading for the "batch" dimension, referring to any test image. And we use SIMD for each image. To compute each pixel, there's a inner-product between vectors. This procedure is done by the reduction function <span class="imp">sum()</span> built in Halide.
</p>

<h5>Pooling Layer</h5>
<blockquote class="parag-418">
Halide::Func sub_maps("sub_maps");<br/>
                Halide::RDom dom(0, pool_x, 0, pool_y);<br/>
                if(pool_func == "max") {<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;        sub_maps(x, y, z, w) = Halide::maximum(last_layer.cnnff(x + dom.x, y + dom.y, z, w));<br/>
                }else if(pool_func == "average") {<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;        sub_maps(x, y, z, w) = Halide::sum(last_layer.cnnff(x + dom.x, y + dom.y, z, w)) / (pool_x * pool_y);<br/>
                }<br/>
                cnnff(x, y, z, w) = sub_maps(x * stride_x - pad_x, y * stride_y - pad_y, z, w);<br/>
        cnnff.vectorize(x, 8);<br/>
                cnnff.compute_root();<br/>

</blockquote>

<p class="parag-418">
Pooling layer is similar to the convolution layer, in that there is a window that traverses the maps, and performs <span class="imp2">reduction</span> at each time. Therefore, similar optimization (similar to the above) can be used in pooling.
</p>
<p class="parag-418">
But we also notice that, pooling doesn't take a large proportion in the overall latency. Therefore, we simply used the built-in reduction function <span class="imp2">max</span>, and vectorized it by SIMD. We didn't choose to use multi-threading, because the overhead is not worthwhile. In our observation, pooling layer of bromide can achieve <span class="imp">10x</span> speedup compared to caffe implementation.
</p>

<div class="par-blankline-10"></div>
<h4>Challenges met and TO-DOs</h4>
<p class="parag-418">
Halide is a language targeted at image processing, which provides a set of computation scheduling methods to help programmers exploit data locality and achieve higher performance when writing parallel programs. However, since it is not designed for deep learning methods, it does not have intrinsic support for the typical computation patterns or algorithms in deep learning, for example, convolution.   Nowadays there are many a mature (sort of) implementation of deep learning methods. <br/><br/>
For example, Caffe, is a frequently seen framework in the world of deep neural networks. One feature about Caffe is that it takes advantage of a fast matrix multiplication library like Intel's MKL when running convolutional neural networks by using matrix multiplications. However, breaking down the convolutional layers to matrix multiplications might not produce a desirable performance speedup since Halide does not natively support matrix multiplication. We thought of using FFT could avoid both the original complex convolution computations and the need for fast matrix multiplication. Although doing the DFT and its inverse will take some time but this might be better than the matrix multiplications way. Anyway, we think doing Fourier transform only makes sense when the weight has one or more huge dimesion(s), so the target that we aim here is to schedule and tune the program using Halide to achieve admissible performance on CPU or GPU. This really turned out to be tough.   It is not easy to understand all the scheduling capabilities provided by Halide. Although the syntax and configurations are made very intuitive and powerful, the conciseness takes a lot of effort to grasp the scheduling. It took us a lot of time to understand and test in terms of making tradeoff between memory bandwidth (locality), parallelism and doing redundant work, which are made more explicit by Halide.<br/><br/> 
</p>

<div class="parag-418">
There are a few ways to approach the convolution operation, we did not test the last two methods because we deem that they would not outperform the first one in our scenarios after our analysis, but for completeness, we would like to continue to compare our current implementaton with them:
<ul class="parag-418-in">
<br/>
<li>Direct convolution with Halide scheduling.</li>
<li>Converting convolution to matrix multiplication, and scheduling with Halide. </li>
<li>Converting convolution to dot product by FFT, and scheduling with Halide.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h5>Future Work</h5>
<p class="parag-418">
The future work will include allowing the program to adaptively select the best scheduling strategy for each network and machine type. Currently, we have to differentiate the details of scheduling for LeNet and AlexNet, such as tiling and reordering. However, it would be a great step if the scheduling stategy can be automatically created for each application.
