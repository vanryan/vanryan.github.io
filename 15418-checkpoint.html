<h4>Summary</h4>
<p class="parag-418">
We are building a framework for deep learning using <a href="http://halide-lang.org/">the Halide image processing language</a>. It is aimed for both training and inferring on deep neural networks, and is expected to achieve high performance on both CPU and GPU.
</p>

<h4>Goals and Deliverables</h4>

<div class="parag-418">
<h5>Plan to achieve:</h5>
<p class="parag-418">
High performance inferring on CNN (native CPU and GPU). It includes convolution, pooling, normalization, activation, and fully-connected layers. We will try improving the performance of forwarding these layers with Halide. </p>
</div>


<h4>Schedule (Revised)</h4>
<div class="parag-418">
<h5>4/1 - 4/8: </h5>

Get familiar with Halide, by studying the toturials;<br/>
Implement the inference process of CNN with Halide: including convolution layers with scheduling and FFT-based approaches, and pooling, normalization, activation and fully connected layers.

<h5>
4/9 - 4/15:</h5>
Implement training process of CNN with Halide;<br/>
Trying using the automatic scheduling tool by Ravi on our program.
<h5>
4/16 - 4/22:</h5>
Select some modern deep neural networks and implement them with Halide. 
<h5>
4/23 - 4/29:</h5>
Compare performance with Caffe on CPU and GPU platforms, in terms of training and inference.
